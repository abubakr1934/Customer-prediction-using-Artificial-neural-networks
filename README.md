# Customer-prediction-using-Artificial-neural-networks
This project focuses on implementing a binary classification model using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting a specific outcome based on input features. The goal is to demonstrate the process of building, training, and evaluating an ANN model using a dataset
